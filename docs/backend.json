    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to securely store and manage access keys for the Crypto Ice Access application. The key principle is Authorization Independence, achieved by avoiding `get()` calls in security rules. Since access keys are essentially global and not user-specific, they are stored in a top-level collection. This design supports QAPs, as listing all access keys would typically be an admin function and thus, secured by checking admin role existence in `/roles_admin/{uid}` (not explicitly modeled here but a standard practice).\n\nThe access keys themselves have a schema with `id`, `key`, `isValid', `purchaseDate`. The `isValid` flag is crucial for quickly disabling access without modifying the key itself. While the application uses anonymous login, which inherently has no user ID, this design assumes a more robust authentication mechanism might be added in the future for administrative purposes. The 'deviceId' field has been removed to allow a key to be used on multiple devices. The 'rewardLimit' and 'totalReward' fields are used to manage the reward system per key. The 'lastFoundDate' is used to control the timing of wallet discovery. The 'limitResetDate' is added to track when the monthly reward limit was last reset. The 'searchTime' field tracks active search duration for cooldown purposes."
