    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to securely store and manage access keys for the Crypto Ice Access application. The key principle is Authorization Independence, achieved by avoiding `get()` calls in security rules. Since access keys are essentially global and not user-specific, they are stored in a top-level collection. This design supports QAPs, as listing all access keys would typically be an admin function and thus, secured by checking admin role existence in `/roles_admin/{uid}` (not explicitly modeled here but a standard practice).\n\nThe access keys themselves have a simple schema with `id`, `key`, `isValid`, and `purchaseDate`. The `isValid` flag is crucial for quickly disabling access without modifying the key itself. While the application uses anonymous login, which inherently has no user ID, this design assumes a more robust authentication mechanism might be added in the future for administrative purposes."
